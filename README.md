# School Admin UI (Frontend Only)

This workspace contains a **frontend-only** school management platform UI with 4 roles:

- Teacher (Admin)
- Principal / Management
- Parent
- Student

No backend, no database, no real AI — only navigation + UI screens with placeholder data.

## React app

The React (Vite) project lives in `react/`.

### Run (dev)

```bash
cd react
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Build (static)

```bash
cd react
npm run build
npm run preview
```
